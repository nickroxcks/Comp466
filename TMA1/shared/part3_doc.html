    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">All images used in this part were taken by myself. No images were
        taken from the web, so I will not be citing any sources. I do appologize the image quality didn't turn out the
        best, but they will at least avoid copyright. All image drawing is done using HMTL Canvas. The assignment
        description for this part was a little ambiguous so I designed this part from how I was able to interpret the
        assignment description. There are 3 animations that can be selected, and you can set the slideshow to either
        random or sequential. In sequential, the images are shown in the order they are set in the JSON data file, and
        in random they are displayed in a random order. To randomize the json data, I utilized the Knuth Shuffle
        Algorithm, a commonly used algorithm for shuffling arrays. You can only press the next and previous buttons
        during sequential mode(as the assignment desription says), and the animations were made by manipulating
        transparency and image positioning, and using javascript intervals. All images will get preloaded once the
        webpage is open, and you can only start the slideshow once all the images have been loaded and the start button
        is made visible.
