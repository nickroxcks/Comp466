<!--It is here where the content presented can be updated from main2.js-->
<div id="main2-banner-content">
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">All files used for part 2 are located in the part2 folder. The folder
        names should be self explanatory, and easy to understand where the files are located. The way this part of the
        assignment is structured is that all units can be accessed from the navigation bar up top. The content for each
        unit will be displayed in the main section container, right beneath the top navigation. Each unit consists of
        several pages to read, and you can move to the next or previous page using the bottons in the bottom navigation.
        I did my best to give some content in each unit that I thought would be useful. In general the pages in each
        unit will contain combinations of text and images to deliver its information. All pages that get loaded into the
        main section container are inside the Main2_html_files folder, with a consistent naming convention. Every quiz
        can be accessed at any time using the top navigation. The quizes will contain a few questions related to the
        topics taught in each unit, and show the users score and correct answers after pressing the submit button. All
        quiz questions and answers are located in the XML data file. The XML structure is very simple, allowing you to
        add as many multiple choice questions as you wish. You just add a multiple choice tag in the
        corresponding
        unit, and provide its responses and answers. The structure of this assignment was designed so that content can
        be easily added without having to edit the existing codebase.
