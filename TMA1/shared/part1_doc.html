    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">As the assignment description asks, this part will open an XML file
        and translate it into useable html code through the use of XSLT. The layout of the xml file is very simple, with
        a tag for each section of the resume. The XML file is built so that additional content can be added and still be
        properly rendered in the browser. For instance, if I wanted to add another bullet point to my work expierience
        section, I could simply add another work_experience_info element and place the additional content in a
        work_experience_content tag. The XSL file will automatically loop through all the content placed in the XML
        file. Finally, I have an XSD file which puts a schema against my XML file. It checks to make sure the XML file
        follows the correct format. I tested my schema against my XML file using several different online tools, such as
        at https://www.freeformatter.com/xml-validator-xsd.html . Final comment on this part, I've removed the buttons
        in the heading in part 1 to make the resume look cleaner. You can use the back button in your browser to
        navigate back to the assignment.
