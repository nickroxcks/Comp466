<div class="main2-banner-title">How to navigate my Assignment</div>
<!--It is here where the content presented can be updated from main2.js-->
<div id="main2-banner-content">
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">The layout of each webpage in my assignment is as follows. There are
        4 main sections to each webpage. The first is the <em class="bold">top navigation</em>. The top
        navigation will always be
        visible, and its contents will change depending on which parts of the assignment you are viewing. For instance
        you are currently viewing the documentation portion of the assignment, so the top navigation contains buttons
        that will take you to documentation for each of the assignment parts. The second section is the <em
            class="bold">left sidebar</em>.
        Clicking the menu button will open up a sidebar to the left, allowing you to select which part of the assignment
        you want to view. Part 1 contains the resume, part 2 contains the web course, part 3 contains the slideshow, and
        part 4 contains the utilities page. You can use this sidebar to access any part of the assignment at any time. I
        hope you find it useful.
        The third section of each webpage is the <em class="bold">content</em>. All the content for each webpage is
        displayed in a section
        container, right below the top navigation. It is within this container that the content for each webpage will be
        updated. Finally, there is the <em class="bold">bottom navigation</em>. The bottom navigation will contain
        buttons such as flipping
        to the next page, going to the previous page, and several others features.
    </p>
    <div class="main2-banner-title">Files for each assignment part</div>

    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">Every part of the assignment has 1 main html file. Each of these html
        files will have shared files located in the shared folder, and files unique to those assignment parts located in
        their corresponging part folder. In the shared folder, every part of the assingment will run the script main.js.
        This will manage the common functionalities between each webpage, such the menu button and sidebar. All styling
        for each assignment is also located in the shared folder in a file called style.css . You may notice much of the
        naming convention is revolved around main2. This is because the second part of the assignment was done first,
        and many aspects of this part were reused in other parts.</p>
    <div class="main2-banner-title">Testing and development enviornment</div>
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">Most of the development for this assignment was made and tested using
        Xampp. I did this because it was recomended in the course. I also tested my HTML and CSS against online
        verification tools, as required for the assignemnt. </p>
    <div class="main2-banner-title">Final Note</div>
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">One final note is that I did choose to use jquery for a couple parts
        of the assignment. This was mostly for updating page content. I did this beause I was trying to experiment with
        different web tools to increase my knowledgebase. I still used XMLHttpRequest whenever
        possible to meet assignment requirements. You can run my program the same way I did by downloading Xampp and
        placing the TMA1 folder inside the htdocs folder. If you have any problems marking my assignment, or have
        questions related to my assignment, please feel free to email me at nserrano@ualberta.ca</p>
