    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">There was only one document I referenced from the web. This was for
        the third utility to find all the canadain tax rates. The exact document I referenced was at
        https://www.retailcouncil.org/resources/quick-facts/sales-tax-rates-by-province/ . Formulas such as calculating
        capital recover and interest values were already learned in other
        courses I have taken. Similar to part 2, I use ajax technologies to update the content in the main container.
        Each tool can be selected from the top navigation bar. Results will be displayed to the user once enough data
        has been provided. This is done through event handlers. For my third tool, I chose to make a canadian tax
        calculator. That is, calculate the total
        tax and cost of a product for the user specified province. I thought this would be useful because I myself
        don't know on the top of my head the different tax rates in each canadian province. This utility removes the
        need to know that knowledge, and will automatically perform the calculations for you.
