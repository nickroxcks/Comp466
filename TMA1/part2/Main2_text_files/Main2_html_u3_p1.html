<div id="main2-banner-content">
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. It is a language used to
        store and transport data. For instance, say you have a website that allows users to view various articles. The
        articles are large, and have a vast ammount of text. One solution of course would be to write the content of
        your article directly into your html for your webpage. If you do this however, it will be very difficult to
        reuse the content of your article on other parts of your webpage. Maybe perhaps you want to make your article
        available to other websites as well. Instead of writing a bunch of text in your html for your article, you could
        instead use XML, which can allow you to store all the text in a simple format. It is also considered good
        practice in the modern age to place large ammounts of text or data in
        other form of data storage. It makes your website structure cleaner, and increases the reusability of your
        content. Lets touch on some of the basics of XML</p>

    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">We can see XML following a very similar tag structure to that of HTML.
        Every tag in XML needs a opening and end tag, and every XML document should be declared with the statement shown
        on line 1. You'll notice the names for each tag are arbitrary. This is because XML data storing language. It has
        no defined syntax for its tag names. All that matters is that the XML structure is correct. This means, we can
        name our tags whatever we wish, unlike the pre-defined tag names in HTML. Tags in XML can be nested, allowing
        you to create chains of tags to clearly define to context of your content. You can also add attributes to
        further describe your context. </p>
