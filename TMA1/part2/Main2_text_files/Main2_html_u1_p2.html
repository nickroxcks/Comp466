<div class="main2-banner-title">Unit 1: Basic HTML elements Part 1</div>
<div id="main2-banner-content">
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">To understand the basics of writing HTML, lets take a look at the
        following example.</p>
    <img class="main2-banner-content-image-centered" src="Main2_images/U1_p2_i1.jpg" />
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">All HTML elements(also reffered to as tags) will take the folowing
        form: &lt;ELEMENT&gt;</p>
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">Every time an element is used, that same element must also have a
        corresponding ending tag, taking the form: &lt;/ELEMENT&gt;</p>
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">Its in between these opening and closing tags, that content for the
        webpage can be placed. If you simply put text between the two tags,
        your web browser will understand that this is markup text, and will display that text in your web browser when
        the page is loaded. You also have the option to nest other opening
        and closing tags. These nestings and groupings of tags are what allow you to create a layout for your webpage.
    </p>

    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">In the example above we see the the <em class="bold">&lt;&#33;DOCTYPE
            html&gt;</em> tag being used. This tag defines that the current document
        is in fact an html document. Its important to include this tag at the top of every html document, because it
        clarifies to the browser what the document is. Not all
        browsers require it, but in order to keep consistency between different browsers its reccomended to always
        include it. This declarating does not require a closing tag.</p>
