<div id="main2-banner-content">
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">In Unit 1, we talked about html and some of the basic html elements
        that are essential for every web developer to know. You may have
        noticed however that a website only written with html looks very generic with no styling whatsoever. This is
        where <em class="bold">Cascading Style Sheets(CSS)</em> comes into play. The purpose of the styling language CSS
        is to manipulate the
        different elements in your html code in order to give them a sense
        of style. That is, make the elements look much more appealing. Lets take a look at our previous example in Unit
        1</p>

    <img class="main2-banner-content-image-centered" src="Main2_images/U1_p2_i1.jpg" />

    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">The HTML code above would result in the following webpage when
        rendered by a browser.</p>

    <img class="main2-banner-content-image-centered" src="Main2_images/U1_p4_i1.jpg" />

    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">As we can see, the text being displayed isn't anything special. It's
        just plain black text that gets placed on the top left of the webpage by default. Lets use CSS to make this webpage look nicer.</p>
