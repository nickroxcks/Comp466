    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">A comment in HTML is displayed in the following form
        form: <em class="bold">&lt;&#33;&#45;&#45;Content of comment&#45;&#45;&gt;</em>.</p>
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">A comment is ignored by all browsers. It is simply a tool used
        by readers of the document to help give information about the document.
    </p>
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">The most important element in html is the html element, taking the
        form: <em class="bold">&lt;html&gt;</em>.</p>
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">This tag is included in every html document. All content in the
        document must be placed in between the opening and closing tags</p>


    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">The next tag used in the example is the head tag, taking the form: <em
            class="bold">&lt;head&gt;</em>.</p>
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">It is between these two tags, where information about the HTML5
        document, such as the character set (UTF-8, the most popular
        character-encoding scheme for the web) is placed. The head tag also links the html file other special related
        documents, such as CSS and JavaScript files</p>
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">The <em class="bold">&lt;meta&gt;</em> tag defines metadata related to the
        document. That is, data (information) about data. Things like
        character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, are what this tag describes. Metadata is not
        displayed in browsers, it is only used. Browsers will
        look at meta tags to understand how the webpage should dsiplay content. In the example above we see charset set
        to utf-8. So browsers will load this webpage, and understand that
        the utf-8 charset is to be used.
    </p>

    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">Charset is considered to be an <em class="bold">attribute</em>.
        Attributes are parameters belonging to certain elements, that can be assigned a value</p>
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">Mulitple attributes can be assigned for a given element. They take the
        form: <em class="bold">&lt;ELEMENT attributeName=VALUE&gt;</em>.</p>
