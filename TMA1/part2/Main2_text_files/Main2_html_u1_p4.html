<div class="main2-banner-title">Unit 1: Basic HTML elements Part 3</div>
<div id="main2-banner-content">
    <img class="main2-banner-content-image-centered" src="Main2_images/U1_p2_i1.jpg" />

    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">The title tag takes the form: <em class="bold">&lt;title&gt;</em></p>
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">You can only have one of these tags in a html document. It defines the
        title of the document.</p>
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">This title can be viewed from the browsers title bar. This title is
        very important for browsers in that it allows
        serach engine algorithms to detect the webpage.</p>
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">The body tag, takes the form: <em class="bold">&lt;body&gt;</em></p>
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">It is within this tag that all the contents of the html documents you
        are reading are placed. For instance all the
        content you are reading in this unit, was placed within a body tag.
    </p>
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">A body tag is unique to an html element. As such there can only be one
        of these tags in each document.
    </p>

    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">The final tag used in the example above is the paragraph tag. It takes
        the form: <em class="bold">&lt;p&gt;</em>
    </p>

    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">The paragraph tag states that the content inside the tag is intended
        to be a paragraph. Browsers automatically add a single blank line after a &lt;p&gt; element. The example has
        some text between these p tags. This means that when the webpage is loaded,
        the text &#34;Welcome to HTML5!&#34; will be displayed.
    </p>

    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">So, if we take the example document above, and load it in our browser, we would get the following web page:
    </p>
    <img class="main2-banner-content-image-centered" src="Main2_images/U1_p4_i1.jpg" />
    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">Thats it for the basic tags of html! You now have the basic knowledge and understanding to build a simple webpage! When you are ready,
        you can select the <em class="bold">first quiz</em> from the navigation menu up top.
