        The TMA2 folder I am submitting with the assignment is very similar to what is saved on the web server. There is a simpledb.sql file to give you an idea of what
        the database looks like, and you can see a couple user accounts saved to give you an example of how the web server is handling saving user files. The localDBConfig
        and db.sql files were used to help transfer my local db to the webserver.

        This is assignment was originally built locally and then transfered to the web server while copying the db over. I haven't encountered any issues with the transfer
        so far but if there is an issue feel free to contact me,
    </p>

    <p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">
        If you encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at nserrano@ulaberta.ca. I will leave the web server online for the next week or so. Soon
        as the assignment is marked, I will be turning the webserver offline to avoid costs.
