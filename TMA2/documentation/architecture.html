    The image above shows a high level overview for the Architecture of the assignment.
    Essentially, the entire website is being run on a live VM
    hosted by digital ocean. This VM follows a LAMP software stack model. LAMP stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. All of these services are installed 
    on the VM itself. I chose this model because it was the most ideal model that meets the assignment requirements(and free of cost). The client application (you) will connect to
    the web server via http through the ip address of the server. All the user needs to do is enter the URL http://143.198.71.129/login.php in their webrowser 
    in order to run the web application. Note, all browser testing for this assignment was done using google chrome and firefox. I have not tested compatability on other browsers.
    I did not want to set a domain name for this website being that it is a smallscale website used only for the purposes for this course, so for now please connect using IP.

    For this assignment, I have chosen to combine both part 1 and 2 into one web application called SimpleDev. 
    So, the same user account is used to access both part 1 and part 2 of this assignment. Essentially, when the user connects to the web server for the first time 
    they are automatically directed to the login screen of the web application. If the user tries to access the Bookmarking Service for example by entering in their 
    browser http://143.198.71.129/part1/main1.php without having have logged in already, 
    the client is automatically redirected to the login screen. The user will not be able to directly connect to any service until they have logged in successfully. After a successful login,
    the user session is stored and the user is presented options to run either the Bookmarking Service or the Lesson Service. The user can navigate between both services whenever
    the wish, so as long as they are logged in. Your session is saved using via php $_SESSION variables, so you can close the browser and then reconnect without having to log back in.
    If the user presses the logout button, they will have to log back in.

        Talking more about the webserver, the image above shows there is a MySQL database stored on the web server called simpledb. This db has several tables used for each part of 
        the assignment. The "users" table, has the columns idusers, username, and password, with the idusers being the primary key of the table. When users create their accounts,
        the account information is stored here.
        You may have noticed in the high level image above, there is a user folder. When you create an account, the web server also creates a direct folder for that user on the 
        webserver stored under Users/U_ID. ID is the id of that user that is stored in the SQL database. So for example if I create a new account and my ID is 7, the webserver
        will create the directory Users/U_7. These user folders are used in primarily in part 2 of the assignment, in order to allow the user to store all their forms of media such
        as images for the lessons they create. More of this is covered in part2 of the documentation.
