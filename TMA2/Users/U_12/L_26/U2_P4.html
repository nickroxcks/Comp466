<div class="main2-banner-title">Unit 2: Basics of CSS and JavaScript Part 4</div><div id="main2-banner-content"><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">For the final topic in this unit we will quickly touch up on some basics about JavaScript. JavaScript is a programming language that is most commonly used for 
                web applications. Javascript allows programmers to add dynamic functionality to their websites. Javascript can perform computations, manipulate html elements, 
                listen for user interactions, and much more. Without JavaScript or other scripting languages, it is very difficult to add dynamic functionality to your webpage.

                JavaScript is a loosely typed language that will allow you to create variables without needing to specifiy a type. Javasript will automatically assign your variable a 
                type based on what information is assigned to it. The syntax for creating a variable is as follows:</p><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">var variableName = value;</p><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">The keyword word var is used when a variable is to be declared, the variable name is the name you are assigning to your variable, and the value is the information you are letting your variable hold. 
                Here's a couple examples with different value types.
                </p><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">var name = "Fred Flinstone";   //This is a string variable</p><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">var number = 5;   //This is a numeric variable</p><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">The next thing you will want to learn is how to write a function in JavaScript. A function has the following syntax:</p><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">function functionName(parm1, param2, param3) { content of function }</p><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">A function is a procedure of instructions that will be run when the function is called. Say we want to write a message when your webpage is loaded. 
                We could do so using function, and call the function as soon as the webpage is loadedd
