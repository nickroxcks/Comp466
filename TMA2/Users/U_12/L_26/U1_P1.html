                    It has a naviation bar on the top of the page, a sidebar on the left side of the page, and a container in the middle that displays content to the user. 
                    This format is all layed out in the HTML5 used for this website.</p><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">It also allows you to display, that is "markup", specific content to the user. This includes text, images, videos, and all sorts of content. 
                Everything you are reading in SimpleDev is being "marked up" by the html, allowing you to view the content.</p><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">Now that we understand the basic uses of html, lets take a look at how to write it.</p></div>
