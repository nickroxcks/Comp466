<div class="main2-banner-title">Unit 2: Basics of CSS and JavaScript Part 3</div><div id="main2-banner-content"><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">To apply our stylesheet to our html file, all that needs to be done is add a link tag within our header. 
                This link tag will allow us to specify the location of the stylesheet so that the html file can apply the styling. 
                We will also add a header into the body to give our webpage a nice logo, as well as some text to demonstrate how we can apply our classes.
                </p><img class="main2-banner-content-image-centered" src="U2_p3_i1.jpg" /><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">All that needs to be done to apply a class to a html element is assign the elements class attribute to our desired class, as shown above. 
                With the CSS applied, we know get the following webpage.
                </p><img class="main2-banner-content-image-centered" src="U2_p3_i2.jpg" /><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">Notice how the logo is written in white text. Because we have not specified a text color for the header in our CSS, the header automatically takes the 
                color property of its parent element. In this case, the header text takes on the same color assigned to the body element.
                </p></div>
