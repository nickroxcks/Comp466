<div class="main2-banner-title">Unit 2: Basics of CSS and JavaScript Part 5</div><div id="main2-banner-content"><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">For our last basic Javascript topic, we will learn how to manipulate html elements. Say we use our previous example as before. 
                The webpage would look like this.</p><img class="main2-banner-content-image-centered" src="U2_p3_i2.jpg" /><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">Lets say we want to use Javascript to change the text on the screen after the user clicks the header. 
                We would first need to give our html elements a unique ID. An ID is a unique reference to an html element. 
                By giving our elements an ID, we can allow our Javascript code to locate the specific html element we wish to change. We can do so like this:
                </p><img class="main2-banner-content-image-centered" src="U2_p5_i1.jpg" /><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">Notice the script tage added in the head tag. This will allow us to link our javascript file to our html file. 
                Now, all we need to do is upate our Javascript code.
                </p><img class="main2-banner-content-image-centered" src="U2_p5_i2.jpg" /><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">Walking through the code, we see we have 2 functions, start and clickHeader. On line 15 we say to run the start function as soon as the window is loaded. 
                Upon loading, the start function finds the mainheader in our html code by referencing its ID, and will listen for when the user clicks the header. 
                If the header gets clicked, we call the clickHeader function. Once the clickHeader function is called, we locate the paragraphs in our html by locating their ID's, 
                and insert our new modified html into the paragraphs. In our case, we are just adding new text. With everything in place, our wepage will now change to this whent he 
                user clicks the header:
                </p><img class="main2-banner-content-image-centered" src="U2_p5_i3.jpg" /><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">Thats it for the basic tags of CSS and JavaScript! You now have the basic knowledge and understanding to build a webpage with some style and dynamic 
                functionality! When you are ready, you can select the second quiz from the navigation menu up top.
