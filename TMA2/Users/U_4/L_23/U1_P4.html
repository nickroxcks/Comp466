                    The title tag takes the form: <title>

                    You can only have one of these tags in a html document. It defines the title of the document.

                    This title can be viewed from the browsers title bar. This title is very important for browsers in that it allows serach engine algorithms to detect the webpage.

                    The body tag, takes the form: <body>. 
                    It is within this tag that all the contents of the html documents you are reading are placed. For instance all the content you are reading in this unit, was placed within a body tag.

                    A body tag is unique to an html element. As such there can only be one of these tags in each document.

                    The final tag used in the example above is the paragraph tag. It takes the form: <p>

                    The paragraph tag states that the content inside the tag is intended to be a paragraph. Browsers automatically add a single blank line after a <p> element. 
                    The example has some text between these p tags. This means that when the webpage is loaded, the text "Welcome to HTML5!" will be displayed.

                    So, if we take the example document above, and load it in our browser, we would get the following web page:
                </p><img class="main2-banner-content-image-centered" src="U1_p4_i1.jpg" /><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">Thats it for the basic tags of html!
