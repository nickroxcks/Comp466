<div class="main2-banner-title">Unit 2: Basics of CSS and JavaScript Part 2</div><div id="main2-banner-content"><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">CSS can be applied to your html code in one of 2 ways. The first is directly into an html file through the use of the style tag. 
                    This method is generally not reccomended, as it makes it difficult to reuse your styling in other html files. 
                    By today's standards its always reccomended to instead use the second method, which is to place the CSS code in a completely seperate file (.css extension). 
                    Lets create a seperate style.css file and walk through the file contents</p><img class="main2-banner-content-image-centered" src="U2_p2_i1.jpg" /><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">
                    CSS files contain collections of Selectors and their assigned attributes and values. A Selector allows you to target speciic HTML elements you want to style. 
                    Selectors can take many forms, but in SimpleDev we will only look at a few. In the example above, the selectors used are colored in yellow text. 
                    Each selector can be assigned its own unique properites and values. The image below shows the syntax for a selector and its properites
                </p><img class="main2-banner-content-image-centered" src="U2_p2_i2.jpg" /><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">One form a selector can take is that it can be named as a specific HTML element. 
                In the example above you can see the selectors body and header were used. This means whatever content is inside these html elements will have the properties specified 
                in the CSS file. In the case of body, the margin and color are specified. The margin property allows us to specify the minimum distance between the given element's 
                border and any outside content. Here we decide to set the top, right, bottom, and left margin to 0, meaning the body will not have a margin and fill the entire window 
                when rendered in the browser. The color property white is aso assigned to the body, stating that any text inside the body tags will be white, so long as the child 
                elements of body arent explicitly assigned their own colors. In the case of the header selector, a color is not assigned here, meaning if we place the header tag inside 
                the body tag in our HTML file, by default the header text will be colored white.</p><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">
                Another form a selector can take is it can take the place of a Class. 
                A Class in CSS allows you to apply style properties to HTML that are assigned the same class name. 
                The selector syntax take the form of a period follow by the name of the class. 
                In the example above, we see the .red being utilized. So whever we assign an html element in out html file the class attribute red, the content within that element 
                will take on the specified red class properites. Now that we've created our CSS file, lets apply our style sheet to our html file.
