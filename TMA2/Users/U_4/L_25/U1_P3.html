                    A comment in HTML is displayed in the following form: <!--Content of comment-->.

                    A comment is ignored by all browsers. It is simply a tool used by readers of the document to help give information about the document.

                    The most important element in html is the html element, taking the
                            form:<html>

                    This tag is included in every html document. All content in the document must be placed in between the opening and closing tags

                    The next tag used in the example is the head tag, taking the form: <head>

                    It is between these two tags, where information about the HTML5 document, such as the character set (UTF-8, the most popular character-encoding scheme for the web) is placed. 
                    The head tag also links the html file other special related documents, such as CSS and JavaScript files

                    The <meta> tag defines metadata related to the document. That is, data (information) about data. Things like character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, 
                    are what this tag describes. Metadata is not displayed in browsers, it is only used. Browsers will look at meta tags to understand how the webpage should dsiplay content. 
                    In the example above we see charset set to utf-8. So browsers will load this webpage, and understand that the utf-8 charset is to be used.

                    Charset is considered to be an attribute. Attributes are parameters belonging to certain elements, that can be assigned a value

                    Mulitple attributes can be assigned for a given element. They take the form: <ELEMENT attributeName=VALUE>.
