                So now that we understands some basics of how to write XML, lets look
                at how we can use XML in our webpage. The Practice of applying Asynchronous JavaScript And
                XML to a webpage is often refered to as AJAX. This technique makes use of the
                XMLHttpRequest object in order to manipulate what is refered to as the HTML DOM. A Document Object Model(DOM) is
                created by the browser when the webpage is loaded, and it defines all the content within the HTML. To
                JavaScript, the DOM acts as an API to allow Javascript to manipulate it. Let's take a look at our html file real
                quick:
                </p><img class="main2-banner-content-image-centered" src="U3_p2_i1.jpg" /><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">
                You can see we have 2 empty paragraphs with no content. We will use
                AJAX to gather xml data to fill the paragraph tags with content. Here is our JavaScript file:
                </p><img class="main2-banner-content-image-centered" src="U3_p2_i2.jpg" /><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">
                We can see in the start function the creation of a XMLHttpRequest
                object. Remeber, the communication between a web server and a client is Asynchronous, as such we will need to
                listen for when the request is ready to be made. We can do this by using the onreadystatechange property of the
                XMLHttpRequest object. A readyState property of 4 means the request is finished and response is ready. The
                status property is the status number of a request, and a status propery of 200 means it is OK. So, with these
                checks in place, we will use the XMLHttpRequest object to open our data XML file and insert the content. With
                everything in play, we see our webpage is now updated to look like the following:
                </p><img class="main2-banner-content-image-centered" src="U3_p2_i3.jpg" /><p class="main2-banner-content-text-centered">
                Thats all for the basics of XML and AJAX! You now have the basic
                knowledge and understanding to build utilizing AJAX! When you are ready, you can select the third quiz from the
                navigation menu up top.
